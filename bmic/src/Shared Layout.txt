----- SHARED LAYOUT -----

THIS HELPS TO BUILD MULTI PAGE WEBSITE WITHOUT HAVING TO LOAD EACH PAGE CLICKED AND TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS OU NEED 
THE HELP OF REACT ROUTER DOM CONTAINING SOME LIBRARIES OF WHICH browserRouter, Routes, and Route are the most used 
perform this operation 

TEH CONCEPT OF SHARED LAY9UT IS TO MAKE A PARTICULALR COMPONENT AVAILABLE IN ALL THE WEBPAGES FOR INSTANCE THE NAVBAR
SUCH THAT WEHN YOU GET TO HOME OR ABOUT OR CONTACT US, YOU WILL SEE THE NAVBAR IN ALL OF THE PAGES. 

THE LAYOUT THAT WILL BE SHARED ACROSS ALL PLATFORMS IS DESIGNED IN A FILE AND LINKED TO OTHER COMPONENT 

== TEH CODE == (coding the shared layout)

Import react from 'react'
import Navbar from 'Navbar'
import {outlet} from 'react-router-dom'

const SHAREDLAYOUT = () => {
    return(

        <div>
                // you import the component you want to be shared across all platform and call it into the return components
                // if you eant FOOTER to be shared across all platform , then you import it and call it into the return 
            <Navbar/>
            <outlet/>
        </div>
    )
}

export default SHAREDLAYOUT


AFTER WRITING THE CODE FOR THE SHARED LAYOUT 


==== CODE FOR USING THE SHARED LAYOUT ====

import Home from './component/Home'
import {BrowserRouter, Routes, Route} from 'react-router-dom'
import SHAREDLAYOUT from './compoenent/SHAREDLAYOUT'

function App() {
    return(
        <div> 
            <BrowserRouter>
                <Routes>
                    <Route  path = "/" element = {<SHAREDLAYOUT/>}> // thi is called the parent tag 

                        <Route index element = {<Home/>}/>  // this is called the children 
                        <Route path = 'about' element= {<About/>}/>
                        <Route path = 'contact' element= {<Contact/>}/>

                    </Route>
                </Routes>
            </BrowserRouter>
        </div>
    )
}




the differernce between REACT-ROUTER-DOM AND SHAREDLAYOUT is that the react-router-dom provides teh libry that allows you \
move to different pages for instance using your navigation key while shared layout allows you to use a share a compoenent on 
multiple pages. for instance, if you want your navbar to be in all your web compoenent so that is remains static even as \
you move from one page to another, then you can use the shared layout 








== THE CODE FOR ROUTING FROM ONE COMPOENTENT TO ANOTHER == 


import Home from "./components/Home"
import {BrowserRouter, Routes, Route} from "react-router-dom"

function App() {

    return(
        <div>

            <BrowserRouter>
            
                <Routes>
                        // the index element is the first page tht eill load as soon as the app launch  while as you navigate 
                        // the PATH will lead you to ohter app such as home and contact. each of the nav element such as about 
                        // and contact must have a seperate page taht was created for it with a link inside it to connect to 
                        // this page
                    <Route index element = {<Home/>}/>
                    <Route path = 'about' element= {<About/>}/>
                    <Route path = 'contact' element= {<Contact/>}/>
                
                </Routes>

            </BrowserRouter>
        
        </div>
    )

}




== CREATING THE NAVBAR ==

import raect from 'react'
import {link, Navlink} from 'react-router-dom'

nb: link and navlink are the same 

const Navbar = () => {
    return (
        
        <nav>
        
            <ul>
                <Navlink to = "/">

                     <li> Home </li>

                </Navlink>

                <link to = "about">
                
                     <li> About </li>

                </link>

                <link to = "contact">
                
                     <li> Contact </li>

                </link>

            </ul>

        </nav>
    )
}


export default Navbar





NORMALLY WITHOUT HTE SHARED LAYOUT , WHAT WE ALWAYS DO IS TO CREATE THE NAVBAR COMPOENENTS, IMPORT IT INTO EACH OF OUR COMPONENT AND CALL
IT IN  THE RETURN BOX BUT WITH THE SHARED LAYOUT THERE IS NO NEED TO IMPORT OR CALL IT BUT ONCE WE CREATE THE SHARED LAYOUT COMPONENT AND
AND LINK IT ,THATS ALL
