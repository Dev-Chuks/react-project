====  USE STATE  ====

Use state is a component in the react libry use to change the current state of a component or update it 
lets take a look at the code below


== CODE ==
import {usestate} from 'react'

const Home = () => {

     // this is teh default setting that is once you open the app, this is what appears "mario is 25 years old"
     // but on clicking the button 'Click me', the OnClick event recorded in the handleclick function is performed 
     // which sets the name and age to "luigi is 30 years old"

     const [name, setName] = useState('mario');  
     const [age, setAge] = useState('25');

// the function 'handleClick' that performs the function of changing the state of the {name} and {age} once clicked
// thereby updating it
    const handleClick = () =>{
        setName('luigi');
        setAge(30)
    }

    return(
        <div>
        
            <h2>Homepage</h2>

            <p> 
                {name} is {age} years old
            </p>

            <button OnClick = {handleClick}> Click me </button>
        </div>
    )
}

export default Home



FROM THE ABOVE EXAMPLE, TEH DEFAULT STYLE IS KEPT IN THE INITIAL DECLARATION OF THE USERSTATE BUT ONCE AN ACTION IS PERFORMED 
WHETHER IT IS CLICKING A BUTTON, HOVERING A MOUSE POINTER, SCROLLING ETC, A FUNCTION MUST BE CREATED TO UPDATE TEH STATE OF HE 
SITE DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU WANT TO BE SONE 

NB: TO USE usestate hooks , YOU MUST IMPLEMENT IT IN A FUNCTION . HENCE THE ABOVE CODE IS EXPORTED AND IMPORTED IN A FUNCION WHERE 
THIS CODD IS RUN . YOU CANT PUT HOOKS IN conditionals, loops , class BUT THEY MUST FIRST BE DEFINED AT TEH TOP LEVELS AND THYE 
WILL RUN CHRONOLOGICALLY




== ANOTHER CODE ==

import react, {useState} from 'react'

function App () {

    // setting our default

    // NB: the order in ths is arranged is const [variablename, function] eg const [count,setCount]
    // hence the setCount is a function that collects the variabl name and performs a fuction with it 
    const [count,setCount] = useState(4)
    const [theme,setTheme] = useState('red')

    function decrement(){
        setCount(count-1)
        setTheme('blue')
    }

    function increment(){
        setCount(count+1)
        
    }

    return(

        <>

        // teh OnClick command senses teh action performed on the button and performs the function of the decrement or increment

            <button OnClick={decrement}>-</button> 
            <span>{count}</span>
             <span>{theme}</span>
            <button OnClick={increment}>-</button>
        
        </>
    )
}

export default App;
