LIST AND KEYS 
this allows you to create multipe stuffs using one original content. this allows you to use a compoenent over and over again 
take for instance, you have a card and you have to replicate that card for 100 users, it would be difficult hard codiing it 
100 times 

hence the list and keys allows you to create one single card and using the list and keys , you can replicate it for different
users using the same cintent and style of the first users

the method of the key and list uses an array method 


const sidebar = () => {

    const sdbardata = {
        {
            key1: list1,
            key2: list2,
            key3: list3
        },

        {
            id:2,
            title: "Clients",
            image: client,
            cName: "sidelinks",
            path: "/clients",
        },

        {
            and it continues 
        },
    };


    return(

        <tablewrapper>
            <table>
                <thead>//table head. These aere rows that will contain thae header content below 

                    <tr>//table row. this is the row containing the headers such as sn, date, email, chat etc
                        
                        <th> S/N </th>//table headers 
                        <th> DATE </th>
                        <th> EMAIL </th>
                        <th> CHAT </th>
                        <th> SMS </th>
                        <th> TOTAL </th>
                                        
                   </tr>

                </thead> // close of table headers 

            // this will map the contents of the object sdbardata into each rows of the table 
                {sdbardata?.map((sdbardata) => {
                    
                    return(
                        <>
                            <tr key = {sdbardata?.id}>
                                <td> {sdbardata.id} </td>
                                <td> {sdbardata.DATE} </td>
                                <td> {sdbardata.EMAIL} </td>
                                <td> {sdbardata.CHAT} </td>
                                <td> {sdbardata.SMS} </td>
                                <td> {sdbardata.TOTAL} </td>
                            
                            
                            </tr>
                        
                        
                        </>
                    )

                })}
            
            </table>
        
        </tablewrapper>
    )




NB: Each <tr></tr> symbolize one row which is populated by data with the <th> </th> tah while in the data section , the 
the <tr> </tr> creates the row wjhile the <td> </td> creates the cells thta populates the data inside hte <td> tag
<td> means table data and creates cells inside the rows of the table and populate it with the data insdie the tag

ASSIGNMENT 
1. CONTSTRUCT A TABLE AND PERFECT THE ART OF CODING IT TO PERFECT THE USE OF USING LIST, KEYS AND MAPPING 

SOLUTION: BUILDING A TABLE USNG REACT 



the wisdom behind this is that say you have a list to populate in a table , you will need to write serferal codes to individually map the 
data in the table but with the help of LIST AND KEYS ,all you need to do is to create a list of teh data in an array using an OBJECT

an OBJECT IS A VARIABLE HTAT CAN CONTAIN MULTIPLE DATA AND IT MAKES USE OF AN ARRAY TO DO THIS WHICH USES A METHOD OF key and content 

after creating the list and key, we can then use MAPPING to map or link all the data content in the table saving us great stress of hours of 
coding
